# Quantitative Structure Activity Relationship (QSAR) study predicts small molecule binding to RNA structure
The diversity of RNA structural elements and their documented role in human diseases make RNA an attractive therapeutic target. However, progress in drug discovery and development has been hindered by challenges in the determination of high-resolution RNA structures and a limited understanding of the parameters that drive RNA recognition by small molecules, including a lack of validated quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSAR). Herein, we developed QSAR models that quantitatively predict both thermodynamic and kinetic-based binding parameters of small molecules and the HIV-1 TAR model system. Small molecules bearing diverse scaffolds was screened against the HIV-1 TAR using surface plasmon resonance. Then multiple linear regression (MLR) combined with feature selection was performed to afford robust models that allowed direct interpretation of properties critical for both binding strength and kinetic rate constants. These models were externally validated with new molecules and their accurate performance confirmed via comparison to ensemble tree methods.

QSAR workflow. A. Input molecules were searched for “protomers” and then searched on conformations of each protomer. Molecular descriptors were calculated for each conformation and averaged based on Boltzmann distribution. B. Small molecules binding HIV-1 TAR were characterized via SPR and parameters including KD, kon and koff were fitted globally. C. With multiple data splitting and independent model training, the final prediction is given by the averaged predictions from multiple learners followed by model interpretation.
